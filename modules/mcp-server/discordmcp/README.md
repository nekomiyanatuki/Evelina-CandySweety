# Discord MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables LLMs to interact with Discord channels, allowing them to send and read messages through Discord's API. Using this server, LLMs like Claude can directly interact with Discord channels while maintaining user control and security.

## Features

- Send messages to Discord channels
- Read recent messages from channels
- Automatic server and channel discovery
- Support for both channel names and IDs
- Proper error handling and validation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- A Discord bot token
- The bot must be invited to your server with proper permissions:
  - Read Messages/View Channels
  - Send Messages
  - Read Message History

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discordmcp.git
cd discordmcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Discord bot token:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

4. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage with Claude for Desktop

1. Open your Claude for Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the Discord MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/discordmcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "your_discord_bot_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude for Desktop

## Available Tools

### send-message
Sends a message to a specified Discord channel.

Parameters:
- `server` (optional): Server name or ID (required if bot is in multiple servers)
- `channel`: Channel name (e.g., "general") or ID
- `message`: Message content to send

Example:
```json
{
  "channel": "general",
  "message": "Hello from MCP!"
}
```

### read-messages
Reads recent messages from a specified Discord channel.

Parameters:
- `server` (optional): Server name or ID (required if bot is in multiple servers)
- `channel`: Channel name (e.g., "general") or ID
- `limit` (optional): Number of messages to fetch (default: 50, max: 100)

Example:
```json
{
  "channel": "general",
  "limit": 10
}
```

## Development

1. Install development dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
```

2. Start the server in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

You can test the server using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

## Examples

Here are some example interactions you can try with Claude after setting up the Discord MCP server:

1. "Can you read the last 5 messages from the general channel?"
2. "Please send a message to the announcements channel saying 'Meeting starts in 10 minutes'"
3. "What were the most recent messages in the development channel about the latest release?"

Claude will use the appropriate tools to interact with Discord while asking for your approval before sending any messages.

## Security Considerations

- The bot requires proper Discord permissions to function
- All message sending operations require explicit user approval
- Environment variables should be properly secured
- Token should never be committed to version control
- Channel access is limited to channels the bot has been given access to
